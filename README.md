# Automated Plant Watering System
This project involves using a combination of hardware and software to develop an automatic plant monitoring and control system.
Utilizes an Arduino board. Separate functional implementations using MATLAB and Java.

### Context
Plants are a very vital part of the environment; they help maintain the planet by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. Many people own plants but often forget to water them during their day-to-day activities. Thus, a system is required to handle this task automatically. By adding an automated plant watering system to a garden or agricultural field, it ensures that all plants reach their fullest potential while minimizing the amount of water wasted.

### Main Idea
Applying the idea of a state machine that takes actions based on things that are measured. This concept is the fundamental building block for this project.

### Results
The computer can be connected to an Arduino board for days or weeks at a time and the soil would receive water and a visual feed of the moisture level in the soil will be created automatically. 

### Conclusions
It is much simpler to grasp how a system operates and the most effective ways to go about developing it when a key concept (state machines in this case) serves as the core foundation. User-defined functions can make it easier to convert data to suit the program.
